##Some context

###_November 5th, 2015_
A dam with mud and waste brakes and invades cities in the state of Minas Gerais. Mariana and Bento Rodrigues were the main cities striken, but others, like Governador Valadares, have no water available because the mud has taken the place of the river they used to drink from. Over 2 thousand people were directly impacted, there is no telling on how big is the damage for our environment. You can read more about it [here](http://g1.globo.com/minas-gerais/noticia/2015/11/barragem-de-rejeitos-se-rompe-em-distrito-de-mariana.html), written in Brazilian Portuguese.

Over 100 people dead in a terrorist attack in Paris. Facebook launches the option of supporting France by merging the user's profile picture with that country's flag. An awesome initiative to support France in this painful moment.

## My idea

Why not do the same for people in Minas Gerais? Maybe I can spread the word that it is important to care for our own problems as well. That's why I created this app that merges the flag of Minas Gerais with an uploaded picture of your own choice.

## The app

- AngularJS
- Foundation
